# Eve-X-Counter
This tool is supposed to read the lines of fleet chat (in realtime (maybe (probably))) and count the number of X's in fleet.
You just need to compile it via Visual Studio and run it.

I think the only depend is .net framework 4.0 but who knows should be easy peasy at least that's what I was aiming for.

If you have questions or w.e. in game mail Kenshin Woo, I'll probably host compiled binarys "soon"tm.
